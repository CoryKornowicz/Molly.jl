Think about learning a smaller number of physically-meaningful parameters before you put in a large neural network and expect it to learn. Whilst it is true that neural networks are universal function approximators, it does not follow that you will be able to train one by differentiating through  a long simulation. A 1000-step simulation with a 10-layer network at each step is analogous to training a 10,000 layer network (with shared weights).\nForward mode autodiff holds much promise for differentiable simulation, provided the number of parameters is small, because the memory requirement is constant in the number of simulation steps.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Molly.jl","page":"Home","title":"Molly.jl","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"(Image: Build status) (Image: Coverage status) (Image: Latest release) (Image: License) (Image: Documentation stable) (Image: Documentation dev)","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Much of science can be explained by the movement and interaction of molecules.
